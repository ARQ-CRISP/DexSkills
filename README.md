<div style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px; text-align: justify;">
Effective execution of long-horizon tasks with dexterous robotic hands remains a significant challenge in real-world problems. While learning from human demonstrations have shown encouraging results, they require extensive data collection for training. Hence, decomposing long-horizon tasks into reusable primitive skills is a more efficient approach. To achieve so, we developed DexSkills, a novel supervised learning framework that addresses long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks using primitive skills. DexSkills is trained to recognize and replicate a select set of skills using human demonstration data, which can then segment a demonstrated long-horizon dexterous manipulation task into a sequence of primitive skills to achieve one-shot execution by the robot directly. Significantly, DexSkills operates solely on proprioceptive and tactile data, i.e., haptic data. Our real-world robotic experiments show that DexSkills can accurately segment skills, thereby enabling autonomous robot execution of a diverse range of tasks.

The dataset provides the following modalities:

 - Proprioception
 - Tactile Sensing

The dataset files are organised as following:

```
DexSkill_dataset
    └─ dataset / Long-horizon task dataset
         └── data_0.pt
         └── ...
         └── data_i.pt
         │   ├── state_input
         │   ├── state_output
         │   ├── feature_input
         │   ├── feature_output
         │   ├── label
    

```


The `.pt` file located within the `/DexSkill_dataset/dataset` includes all recorded demonstrations for 20 distinct primitive skills. To enhance generalization and avoid overfitting, the datasets are shuffled during the creation process. Additionally, within the `/DexSkill_dataset/LH_dataset` folder, each `.pt` file correspond to a specific long-horizon manipulation task, with no shuffling involved to preserve the time-series sequence of these tasks. 

Furthermore, the `json_file` within this dataset provides human-labeled task segmentation for all long-horizon tasks, serving as a ground truth. 

All trained policies, including those of our framework and comparative works, are inside the `trained_policy` folder.
